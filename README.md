## Image To Text Converter in PHP

An image to text converter, also known as an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool, is a technology that allows you to extract text from images or scanned documents. It analyzes the image and identifies characters, words, and paragraphs, converting them into editable text that can be recognized by a computer.

OCR technology uses advanced algorithms to recognize and interpret the shapes and patterns of text within an image. It can handle various types of images, including scanned documents, photographs, screenshots, and even handwritten text. The extracted text can then be copied, edited, searched, or saved in various formats such as plain text, Microsoft Word documents, PDFs, or other compatible file formats.

To convert an image to text, you can use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology. In this codebase, we will be using Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) with PHP Programming Language.

Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is an open-source software library developed by Google. It is designed to recognize and extract text from images or scanned documents. Tesseract OCR can be used to convert printed or handwritten text into machine-readable text.

Originally developed at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories in the 1980s and later acquired by Google in 2006, Tesseract OCR has been actively maintained and improved over the years. The library supports over 100 languages, including various scripts and writing systems.

Tesseract OCR works by analyzing the patterns and shapes of characters in an image. It employs advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to segment the image into individual characters and then recognize them based on their shapes and context. The library can handle various types of documents, including invoices, receipts, books, and more.

While Tesseract OCR is primarily a command-line tool, there are also several graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and wrappers available that make it easier to use for non-technical users. The library has APIs for multiple programming languages, including Python, Java, C++, and others, allowing developers to integrate OCR capabilities into their applications.

NB: This has been done queit long time, when Tesseract OCR v3 was released and the code is still working for v5, I just thought of pushing to public repo for my co-developers or students, maybe it might be helpful. And this is a windows based program which mean it runs on windows system or server. Thanks
